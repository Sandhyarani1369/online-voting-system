        <p><strong>Party:</strong> Rising Stars</p>
        <p><strong>Vision:</strong> Strengthening economic growth and social welfare for a prosperous and self-reliant society.</p>
        <p>A strong society is built on the pillars of economic empowerment, social welfare, and self-reliance. My vision is to create a student community that values financial literacy, skill development, and social responsibility, ensuring that we contribute not only to our personal growth but also to the betterment of society as a whole.

            Economic growth begins with knowledge and opportunity. I believe in equipping students with entrepreneurial skills, leadership training, and financial education to prepare them for a future where they can thrive in a competitive world. By promoting startup culture, career-oriented workshops, and internships, we can empower students to become job creators rather than job seekers.</p>
